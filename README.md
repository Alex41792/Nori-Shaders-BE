# Nori-Shaders-BE
this is a shader for minecraft be (mobile) for opengl es 3.0 or above, this shader has a unique feature which not all shaders have and physical texture-based rendering (PBR) is its own uniqueness but other than that all the coloring on the shader is only based on color minecraft's built-in fog so the resulting color is uncertain.
